# 5.0 - Extra Credit!

Put your vast knowledge of Arduino to use and build a new project based on what we did so far. Suggestions:

1. Build a blinking lights display with multiple LEDs.

2. Combine blinking LEDs and the light theremin *(note: tone() interferes with pin 11 and 3, delay() interferes with pin 5 and 6, so you can end up with odd results)*.

3. Use another sensor to set variables for blink or theremin, for example a potentiometer or temperature sensor.

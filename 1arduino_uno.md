# 1.0 - Introducing Arduino UNO 

Meet your *microcontroller*!

[Arduino UNO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno) is an easy to use prototyping board based on **open-source** hardware and software. It can be programmed using Arduino's basic [language](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage) to create interactive physical computing projects. 

> "Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. " -- Learn more from the [Arduino Guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction)

For examples and inspiration check out the [Project Hub](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub).

# 1.1 - Breadboard 

That white thing attached to your UNO? Its a solderless breadboard!

Breadboard make it easy to create circuits without soldering any wires together. 
The connection is made by inserting wire into the tiny holes: 

- Each pin hole on a `Rail` is connected vertically.
- Each pin hole in a `Row` is connected horizontally. 
- A `Split` runs down the middle dividing the board in two.

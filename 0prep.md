# 0.0 - Preparation 

For this workshop you will need:

- Arduino UNO and usb cable.
- a few basic electronic components, as found in most Arduino starter kits: a breadboard, some jumper wires, a piezo, a 10k ohm resistor, a few 330 ohm resistors, a photoresistor, and a few LEDs.
- [Arduino Software IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) installed on your computer. Arduino IDE is a [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and open-source software. Detailed installation instructions are available for [Linux](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux), [Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows), and [Mac](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX). Alternatively, sign up for an online IDE service such as [Arduino Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor) (note: if you use Chrome OS it will be necessary to use an online editor). 

*[[The MILL](http://mill.lib.uidaho.edu/) will provide all these required materials. However, it will be helpful to set up Arduino IDE on your own computer so that it and the code you write in the workshop will be available for you in the future.]*
